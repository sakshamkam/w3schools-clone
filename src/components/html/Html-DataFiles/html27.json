  "gp1": "The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.",
  "gp2": "The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.",
  "gp3": "HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.",
  "gp4": "Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.",
  "gp5": "The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.",
  "gp6": "The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.",
  "gp7": "The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:",
  "gp8": "The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.",
  "wp1": "The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.",
  "wp2": "The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.",
  "wp3": "The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.",
  "wp4": "This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.",
  "wp5": "The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).",
  "wp6": "The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.",
